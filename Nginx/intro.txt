# Intro

- Nginx : Nginx, pronounced like “engine-ex”, is an open-source web server that, since its initial success as a web server, is now also used as a reverse proxy, HTTP cache, and load balancer.
- Reverse Proxy: A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network 
    and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server. 
    A reverse proxy provides an additional level of abstraction and control to ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and servers.
